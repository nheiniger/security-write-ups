In this challenge we are given a picture on top of the description

Googling a bit tells us that this code comes from the "Prison break" serie and we can find descriptions on how to decode online, for example <http://www.wonderlandblog.com/wonderland/2006/08/prison_break_se.html>. Using this method we decode the message as follows using the number of dots on the picture and the phone numbers:
```
1 3 3 4 3 2 2 3 3 4 2 3 2 1
7 7 4 7 6 6 3 7 4 7 5 4 6 4
p r i s o n e r i s k i n g
```

Our password is `prisonerisking` and when entering it we get the egg:
