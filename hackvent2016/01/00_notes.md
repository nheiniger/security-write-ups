Day 01: Detours
---------------
We first see that every link redirects to the same picture. When visiting the URLs with a browser through Burp we see that each of them redirects through a different link. These links are:

- <http://bit.do/HV16-t8Kd>
- <http://bit.do/38aY-QxL5>
- <http://bit.do/bn4K-c6Lw>

We recognize the flag format and when assembling them get the full flag:

> HV16-t8Kd-38aY-QxL5-bn4K-c6Lw
