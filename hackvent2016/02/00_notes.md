Day 02: Free Giveaway
---------------------
The data format looks like the flag already, has the good character length and the 16 in place. The hint points us to keyboard layouts. We need to "translate" the data between QWERTY and Dvorak layout. I used 2 different online converters to get a satisfying result:

- <http://awsm-tools.com/text/keyboard-layout>
- <https://spyrosoft.com/tools/qwerty-to-dvorak-translator.html>

And in the end we get the flag by combining both outputs:

> HV16-SDhs-qqpf-zQLp-OQH4-2Xmg
