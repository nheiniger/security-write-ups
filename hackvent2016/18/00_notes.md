Day 18: Calling Santa
---------------------
In this challenge we have to spoof our caller ID such that the voicemail accepts our phone call. Some online services allows to do that with SIP client. I used voip.ms [1], created an account, added funds, configured caller ID to +41 76 000 00 00 and set up a SIP client (zoiper) on my smartphone. Then I could call the number and get the voice message.

After that we are told to press certain keys to access to a real monkey, a real hacker, a real cracker and eventually a real security professional. So in turn we press 1, 13, 133 and finally 1337. Which gives a congratulations and the flag is also given:
