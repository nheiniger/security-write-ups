Bonus flag 02
=============
In challenge 18, some ISO file is given with what looks like a playstation game. One can at least partly run the game using rpcs3, <https://rpcs3.net>. When running the game from here, two flags are displayed, the first one is this bonus flag, the second one is obviously a fake:

And the flag is:
```
HV17-Muq9-gzvU-t3Bg-O3jo-iGml
```
