Day 01: 5th anniversary
=======================
> *time to have a look back*

Let's have a look at the solutions from the previous years. Those can be found online, many writeups exist. I chose this one: <https://github.com/shiltemann/CTF-writeups-public>

We have the first characters already given in the svg picture:
```
HV17-5YRS-4evr-
```

Then we get the flags from previous years:
```
HV24-BAAJ-6ZtK-IJHy-bABB-YoMw
HV15-Tz9K-4JIJ-EowK-oXP1-NUYL
HV16-t8Kd-38aY-QxL5-bn4K-c6Lw
```

And reconstruct the full flag from the pieces:
```
HV17-5YRS-4evr-IJHy-oXP1-c6Lw
```
